# Profile
I am a mobile engineering leader who builds high-performing teams, ships impactful products, and systematically improves people and processes. Over the last decade, I have combined end-to-end product ownership as the founder of Leio with large-scale technical leadership at Wex, managing multiple teams in a white-label ecosystem of over 640 mobile apps. My background in psychology and philosophy helps me drive technical excellence, operational discipline, and a culture of psychological safety.

# Selected Highlights
- **Global Management:** I've managed over 30 engineers in 4 cross-cultural teams spanning the US, Brazil, and India (including vendor partners).
- **Product Ownership:** I founded and operate Leio, a top-100 iOS app with ~1,500 monthly active users, thousands of 5-star ratings, and six-figure lifetime revenue over 10 years.
- **Operational Excellence:** I led a CI/CD transformation that cut release cycles from months to under one hour, enabling prompt resolution of customer-impacting issues.
- **Engineering Leadership at Scale:** I led the reduction of crash rates from >4% to <0.25% across 640+ enterprise mobile apps used by major US financial institutions.
- **Crisis Management:** I reduced production incident response time from 3+ days to under one hour by driving improvements in telemetry, observability, and incident playbooks.

# Professional Experience

- **Quality Engineering:** I reduced crash rates from >4% to <0.25% through rigorous quality frameworks and architecture standardization.
- **Global Leadership:** I managed 4 cross-functional squads (~30 engineers including vendor partners) across native iOS, Android, and .NET backend domains.
- **People & Hiring:** I owned performance management and growth plans for my direct reports and actively shaped hiring, interview process design, promotions, and staffing decisions across the mobile organization.

## Wex Inc. — Tech Lead Manager (2024–2025)

I led and scaled multiple high-performing engineering squads, driving modernization, observability, and delivery excellence.

### Achievements

## Wex Inc. — Senior iOS Engineer (2022–2024)

I delivered critical features and laid the groundwork for how the mobile organization hires, onboards, and modernizes its codebases.

### Achievements
- **Onboarding & Foundations:** As the first member of my team and the first Brazil-based engineer in the org, I created onboarding materials and frameworks that became the template for future hires.
- **Mentorship:** I mentored junior and mid-level engineers, helping them ramp up on legacy codebases and modern patterns.
- **Modernization & Architecture:** I drove the migration of legacy Objective‑C and Java code to Swift and Kotlin, and initiated a move toward a more modular app architecture that the teams are now completing.
- **Code Quality & Tooling:** I set code standards and introduced tooling such as SwiftLint to enforce them, improving consistency and reducing review friction.
