# Professional Experience

## Wex Inc. — Senior Engineering Manager (2025–Present)
*Lead a strategic mobile division of ~30 engineers, managing a layer of engineering managers and vendor partners.*

I oversee the engineering strategy and delivery for a massive white-label ecosystem of over 640 mobile apps (Bank of America, PNC Bank, Voya). I operate as a "Manager of Managers," responsible for organizational health, leadership development, and vendor strategy.

### Achievements
- **Organizational Leadership:** Scaled the organization to 4 cross-functional squads (~30 engineers), directly managing internal engineering managers and directing the work of external vendor managers across native iOS, Android, and .NET backend domains.
- **Operational Excellence:** Led a CI/CD transformation that cut release cycles from months to under one hour for the entire portfolio, enabling same-day fixes for critical issues.
- **Quality Engineering:** Reduced crash rates from >4% to <0.25% through rigorous quality frameworks and architecture standardization.
- **Vendor Strategy:** Managed high-stakes vendor relationships, integrating offshore partner teams (India/Brazil) into the core engineering culture and delivery cadence.
- **People Strategy:** Owned the talent lifecycle for the organization, including hiring strategy, performance calibration, and designing promotion paths for staff engineers and new managers.

## Wex Inc. — Tech Lead Manager (2024–2025)
*Scaled a single team into multiple specialized squads while driving modernization and delivery excellence.*

- **Team Scaling:** Scaled a single team into multiple specialized squads, mentoring new leads and defining engineering maturity models.
- **Strategic Alignment:** Collaborated with product leadership to align resource allocation with high-impact roadmap initiatives.
- **Hiring & Process:** Redesigned interview loops and assessment metrics to improve hiring quality, clarifying metrics and milestones used in performance assessment and promotion discussions.

## Wex Inc. — Senior iOS Engineer (2022–2024)
*Delivered critical features and laid the groundwork for how the mobile organization hires, onboards, and modernizes its codebases.*

- **Onboarding & Foundations:** As the first member of my team and the first Brazil-based engineer in the org, created the onboarding frameworks that became the standard for future global hires.
- **Mentorship:** Mentored junior and mid-level engineers, facilitating their transition from legacy codebases to modern patterns.
- **Modernization:** Drove the migration of legacy Objective‑C/Java to Swift/Kotlin and initiated the move toward a modular architecture.
- **Code Quality:** Established coding standards and introduced automated tooling to enforce consistency.
