# Profile
I am a mobile engineering leader who builds high-performing teams, ships impactful products, and systematically improves people and processes. Over the last decade, I have combined end-to-end product ownership as the founder of Leio with large-scale technical leadership at Wex, managing multiple teams in a white-label ecosystem with over 640 mobile apps. My background in psychology and philosophy helps me drive technical excellence, operational discipline, and a culture of psychological safety.

# Selected Highlights
- **Global Management:** I manage more than 30 engineers in 4 cross-cultural teams spanning the US, Brazil, and India (including vendor partners).
- **Product Ownership:** I founded and operate Leio, a top-100 iOS app with ~1,500 monthly active users, thousands of 5-star ratings, and six-figure lifetime revenue over 10 years.
- **Operational Excellence:** I led a CI/CD transformation that cut release cycles from months to under one hour, enabling prompt resolution of customer-impacting issues.
- **Engineering Leadership at Scale:** I led the reduction of crash rates from >4% to <0.25% across 640+ enterprise mobile apps used by major US financial institutions.
- **Crisis Management:** I reduced production incident response time from 3+ days to under one hour by driving improvements in telemetry, observability, and incident playbooks.

# Professional Experience

## Wex Inc. — Software Engineering Manager (2025–Present)

I lead multiple mobile engineering teams responsible for a massive white-label ecosystem of over 640 mobile apps, serving major enterprise clients such as Bank of America, PNC Bank, Voya and Chard Snyder.

### Achievements
- **Organizational Design:** I restructured team allocation to optimize cross-timezone coverage (US, Brazil, India) and reduce cross-team dependencies.
- **Operational Excellence:** I led a CI/CD transformation that cut release cycles from months to under one hour for the entire portfolio and enabled same-day fixes for critical issues.
- **Quality Engineering:** I reduced crash rates from >4% to <0.25% through rigorous quality frameworks and architecture standardization.
- **Global Leadership:** I managed 4 cross-functional squads (~30 engineers including vendor partners) across native iOS, Android, and .NET backend domains.
- **People & Hiring:** I owned performance management and growth plans for my direct reports and actively shaped hiring, interview process design, promotions, and staffing decisions across the mobile organization.

## Wex Inc. — Tech Lead Manager (2024–2025)

I led and scaled multiple high-performing engineering squads, driving modernization, observability, and delivery excellence.

### Achievements
- **Incident Management:** I reduced production incident response times from >3 days to <1 hour by leading improvements in telemetry, observability, and on-call practices.
- **Team Scaling:** I scaled a single team into multiple specialized squads, mentoring new leads and defining engineering maturity models.
- **Strategic Alignment:** I collaborated with product leadership to align resource allocation with high-impact roadmap initiatives.
- **Hiring & Process:** I interviewed and evaluated many candidates, improved interview questions and loops, and clarified metrics and milestones used in performance assessment and promotion discussions.

## Wex Inc. — Senior iOS Engineer (2022–2024)

I delivered critical features and laid the groundwork for how the mobile organization hires, onboards, and modernizes its codebases.

### Achievements
- **Onboarding & Foundations:** As the first member of my team and the first Brazil-based engineer in the org, I created onboarding materials and frameworks that became the template for future hires.
- **Mentorship:** I mentored junior and mid-level engineers, helping them ramp up on legacy codebases and modern patterns.
- **Modernization & Architecture:** I drove the migration of legacy Objective‑C and Java code to Swift and Kotlin, and initiated a move toward a more modular app architecture that the teams are now completing.
- **Code Quality & Tooling:** I set code standards and introduced tooling such as SwiftLint to enforce them, improving consistency and reducing review friction.

I own the end-to-end product lifecycle for Leio, a top-rated reading management app with a decade of continuous evolution and thousands of five-star ratings.

### Achievements
- **Product Strategy & Execution:** I built and scaled a successful consumer product from zero to top-100 in Brazil, growing to ~1,500 monthly active users with thousands of five-star ratings and low six-figure lifetime revenue over 10 years, while managing ideation, UX, roadmap, and marketing.
- **Technical Evolution:** I evolved the codebase from Objective-C/Swift 1 to Swift 6, transitioning to SwiftUI, strict concurrency, and a modular SPM architecture.
- **Business Operations:** I managed all aspects of the business including App Store optimization, legal compliance, and customer support.
